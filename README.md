# EnemyRandomizer

https://github.com/Kerr1291/EnemyRandomizer

This is a mod for [Hollow Knight](http://hollowknight.com/) that randomizes the Enemies.

It can be quite jank, but very fun.

## Release Installation

Get via one of the mod installers like scarab: https://github.com/fifty-six/Scarab

## Usage

By default, the randomizer will change each enemy type into another random type, and this will remain constant between rooms. 
This behaviour can be changed in the settings menu
Look under Mods > Enemy Randomizer 

## Known Bugs
COMING SOON
