# EnemyRandomizer

https://github.com/Kerr1291/EnemyRandomizer

This is a mod for [Hollow Knight](http://hollowknight.com/) that randomizes the Enemies.

It can be quite jank, but very fun.

Find me here to give feedback, ideas, etc. Or use github, whichever!

Get via one of the mod installers like scarab: https://github.com/fifty-six/Scarab

## Usage

By default, the randomizer will change enemies into another random type, with various options to configure how that should work. 
This behaviour can be changed in the mod menus

To start,
Look under OPTIONS > MODS > ENEMY RANDOMIZER OPTIONS > ENEMY RANDOMIZER MODULES  

## Known Bugs
Plenty. This is an alpha release, so there's still a lot of work to do.
