# EnemyRandomizer

https://github.com/Kerr1291/EnemyRandomizer

This is a mod for [Hollow Knight](http://hollowknight.com/) that randomizes the Enemies.

It can be quite jank, but very fun.

## Release Installation

Get via one of the mod installers (will link here soon)

## Usage
Click the [LOAD ENEMY RANDOMIZER] button in the top-left of the main menu to load the randomizer.

By default, the randomizer will change each enemy type into another random type, and this will remain constant between rooms. This behaviour can be changed, as below.

## Settings
 - Chaos Mode - Each enemy will be fully randomized with no restrictions when you enter a new room. Enemies of the same type can be changed into different things.
 - Room Mode - Each enemy type will be re-randomized each time you enter a new room, but it will still change every enemy of that type.
 - Randomize Geo - Randomizes amount of geo dropped by enemies
 - Custom Enemies - Allows custom enemies to be added to the randomizer
 - Godmaster Enemies - Allows enemies from the Godmaster expansion to be included in the randomizer. This includes Absolute Radiance, Pure Vessel, Winged Nosk, Mato, Oro, Sheo, Sly and Eternal Ordeal enemies.
 - (Cheat) No Clip - Turns on no clip - to be used in case of a bug that blocks progression by normal means, e.g. a door not opening after a boss has been killed.

## Known Bugs
Certain bosses will not spawn if they have been killed elsewhere, such as Flukemarm, but their item drops will still function as normal and be found in the empty boss arena.

Trial of the Fool is broken - don't do it.
